print("""buttons.py - Detect which button has been pressed

This example should demonstrate how to:
1. set up RPi.GPIO to read buttons,
2. determine which button has been pressed

# The buttons on Pirate Audio are connected to pins 5, 6, 16 and 24

# These correspond to buttons A, B, X and Y respectively

# Set up RPi.GPIO with the "BCM" numbering scheme
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Buttons connect to ground when pressed, so we should set them up
# with a "PULL UP", which weakly pulls the input signal to 3.3V.

# "handle_button" will be called every time a button is pressed
# It receives one argument: the associated input pin.
